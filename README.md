<h2>Noty - An iOS8 iCloud demonstration app</h2>
<p>
This app is a simple note app.<br><br>
It is not at all well designed, but it has every functionality to demonstrate how to use iCloud. How to create, delete, (though no rename function), conflict resolution, etc.<br><br>
It is created based on a wonderful tutorial on raywenderlich.com:<br><br>
http://www.raywenderlich.com/6015/beginning-icloud-in-ios-5-tutorial-part-1.<br><br>
The original tutorial was written a few years ago, so some minor adjustment was made. I hope beginners of iCloud programming can use this as a starting point and create some awesome stuff.
